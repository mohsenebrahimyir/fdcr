<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Susceptibility</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Indicates the potential for developing a disease or medical condition in an individual who does not currently have the clinically apparent disease or the medical condition
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Baseline cue-reactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula was greater in individuals who subsequently transitioned from moderate to heavy drinking compared to non-transitioners (Dager et al., 2014)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Diagnostic</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Detects or confirms the presence of a disease or condition of interest, or identifies individuals with a subtype of the disease
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<p><strong>SUDs vs. Healthy:</strong></p>
<p>*Individuals with cocaine use disorder showed higher FDCR compared to controls in a frontoparietal network (Costumero et al., 2018)</p>
<p>*Individuals with cocaine use disorder compared to people with recreational stimulant use showed greater orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate FDCR during a cocaine-cue Stroop task (Smith et al., 2014)</p>
<p><strong>SUD Subtyping:</strong></p>
<p>*Among people with heavy alcohol consumption, “relief” drinking (due to negative reinforcement or habit) compared to reward drinking (due to positive reinforcement) was associated with greater dorsal striatal FDCR (Burnette et al., 2021)</p>
*Individuals with cannabis use disorder and early-onset cannabis use showed FDCR in the dorsal striatum, while those with late-onset use showed FDCR in the ventral striatum (Wetherill et al., 2016)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Severity</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Is correlated with greater intensity of the disease
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In individuals with opioid use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala was associated with drug use severity (Addiction Severity Index Drug Composite Score), and withdrawal symptoms mediated the relationship between nucleus accumbens FDCR and drug use severity (Shi et al., 2021)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Prognostic</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Identifies the likelihood of a clinical event, disease recurrence, or progression in patients who have the disease or medical condition of interest
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Among individuals with stimulant use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens was prospectively associated with time to relapse and could classify individuals into those who would relapse and those would not at 3 months after the scan, with an accuracy outperforming predictions using self-reported and clinical measures (MacNiven et al., 2018)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Monitoring</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Is measured repeatedly for assessing the status of a disease or medical condition or for evidence of exposure to (or effect of) a medical product or environmental agent
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<p><strong>Naturalistic Monitoring:</strong></p>
<p>*Among women with tobacco use disorder, frontal, temporal, and parietal regions showed FDCR during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle but not the luteal phase (Mendrek et al., 2014)</p>
<p>*Among participants with internet gaming disorder (IGD) followed over one year, natural recovery from IGD was associated with decreased anterior cingulate and lentiform FDCR and an increase in cue-related effective anterior cingulate cortex-lentiform connectivity (Dong et al., 2019)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Monitoring:</strong></p>
In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with alcohol use disorder, naltrexone lowered ventral striatal FDCR from baseline, and more FDCR reduction was associated with greater clinical response (Schacht et al., 2017)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Predictive</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The existence or intensity of the biomarker reflects the propensity of individuals to experience favorable or unfavorable effects from exposure to a medical product or environmental agent
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<p>*In individuals with alcohol use disorder, the existence of left putamen FDCR at baseline and the reduction of left putamen FDCR early during treatment predicted the effectiveness of naltrexone (Bach et al., 2020)</p>
*In individuals with alcohol use disorder, high baseline FDCR in the ventral striatum statistically predicted response to naltrexone (Mann et al., 2014). Notably, this finding has been directly replicated (Bach et al., 2021)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Response</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Shows that a biological effect has occurred in an individual exposed to a medical product or environmental agent
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<p><strong>Biological Response:</strong></p>
<p>In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with cocaine use disorder, modafinil acutely reduced FDCR in the ventral tegmental area and increased FDCR in the anterior cingulate and putamen, eliminating differences between participants with cocaine use disorder and healthy control participants (Goudriaan et al., 2013)</p>
<p><strong>Potential Surrogate Endpoint:</strong></p>
In a randomized sham-controlled trial involving people with tobacco use disorder, active versus sham tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) increased cue-related functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the parahippocampus, and this increase was correlated with decreased cigarette craving (Yang et al., 2017)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Safety</strong>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Is measured before or after an exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent to indicate the likelihood, presence, or extent of toxicity as an adverse effect
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Contributing to discussions on the safety of electronic cigarettes, FDCR showed that e-cigarette smoking may immediately increase FDCR (T. T. Nichols et al., 2016). Furthermore, sweet taste and nicotine content may synergistically influence the nucleus accumbens FDCR to the sight and smell of e-cigarettes (Kroemer et al., 2018). Safety FDCR biomarkers may overlap with prognostic or response biomarkers in the context of SUDs since SUDs involve the use of substances whose safety may be assessed using FDCR
