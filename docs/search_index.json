However, no FDCR-derived biomarker has yet seen FDA drug development approval or clinical adoption. Traversing this translational gap requires a systematic assessment of the available evidence, mapping the methodological heterogeneity of FDCR, and an evaluation of possible clinical uses of FDCR-derived biomarkers to focus research and validation efforts. The present work presents a systematic review of 357 FDCR studies from 18 countries published from 1998 till the end of 2020. Most of the literature has been focused on nicotine (31.4%), alcohol (27.7%) and cocaine (11.8%); and most studies (79.6%) utilize purely visual cues, including either pictorial (70.6%) or video (9%) stimuli. These studies together have recruited 1.5913^{4} participants, including 1.1496^{4} individuals with past or current SUD. Based on their designs, these 357 studies may inform the development of diagnostic (37.8%), response (33.6%), severity (18.8%), prognostic (6.8%), predictive (5.5%), monitoring (2.9%) and susceptibility assessment (0.5%) FDCR-derived biomarkers. Notably, 128 studies have used FDCR in the context of pharmacological (53 studies) and cognitive/behavioral (50 studies) interventions. Counting overlaps, 120 studies used FDCR as a response biomarker and 104 reported significant FDCR alterations as a result of treatment, and 21 used FDCR as a predictive biomarker with 20 explaining significant portion of the treatment outcome. Based on this systematic review and the biomarker development frameworks and FDA guidelines, we outline a pathway for the development and regulatory qualification of FDCR-based biomarkers of addiction and recovery. Further analytical and clinical validation and cost-benefit analyses within this pathway will support FDCR-derived biomarkers to be used in clinical trials to accelerate treatment development or be employed for direct clinical use. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Background on substance use disorders and relevant challenges Biomarkers in psychiatry and addiction medicine Reactivity to addiction-relevant cues as a promising paradigm for biomarker development Lack of biomarkers with regulatory approval in addiction medicine Overview of a proposed framework for the development of FDCR-derived biomarkers: The biomarker’s context of use should be decided whether it is to be used in the clinic or in drug development. Some contexts of use likely address more important gaps, and some are easier to provide validating evidence for. Contexts of use also influence choices of methodological parameters during biomarker specification. Any FDCR-derived biomarker first needs to be precisely specified. Various methodological choices, such as the target population, standard operating procedures, image acquisition parameters, and analytical choices impact FDCR results and need to be chosen before validation. A validation protocol has three aspects. Analytical validation involves establishing basic characteristics of the FDCR-derived biomarker, such as its reliability and validity, its natural variation, effect sizes needed to be observed for it to reliably detect differences, etc. Clinical validation involves elucidating the etiological link of the biomarker to a substance use disorders and establishing that it is reliably associated with current or future disease or recovery. Lastly, the biomarker needs to address a substantial gap and demonstrate cost-effectiveness, especially given the high costs of fMRI scanning and potential harms of false negative or positive results. The compiled evidence is then presented for regulatory approval. The FDA evaluates the use of biomarkers in the development of FDA-approved drugs through a biomarker qualification process involving the submission of a Letter of Intent, a Qualification Plan, and a Full Qualification Package, and may announce its approval after an iterative process. A Letter of Support may be issued by the FDA to indicate its support for a biomarker, before formal qualification is initiated. Use of biomarkers in preclinical or clinical contexts requires the endorsement of a constellation of other institutions, and we are not aware of a single formalized validation pathway. An overview of the framework is provided in Figure 1. While the figure is developed with respect to the federal regulatory context in the US, the framework is likely broadly relevant in other institutional contexts "],["four-major-steps-in-the-validation-of-fmri-drug-cue-reactivity-fdcr-derived-biomarkers.html", "Four major steps in the validation of fMRI drug cue reactivity (FDCR)-derived biomarkers", " Four major steps in the validation of fMRI drug cue reactivity (FDCR)-derived biomarkers Figure 1: Four major steps in the validation of fMRI drug cue reactivity (FDCR)-derived biomarkers.

After the analytical and clinical validation of the biomarker and cost-benefit analysis, the compiled evidence is presented for regulatory approval.

Note that potential FDCR-derived safety biomarkers were very rare in the database, and thus have not been included as a separate category in other tables and figures. Biomarker Type Description (Adapted from the BEST Glossary) Examples Susceptibility Indicates the potential for developing a disease or medical condition in an individual who does not currently have clinically apparent disease or the medical condition Baseline cue-reactivity in the VMPFC, OFC, ACC, striatum and insula predicts transitioning from moderate to heavy drinking (Dager et al., 2014). Diagnostic Detects or confirms the presence of a disease or condition of interest, or identifies individuals with a subtype of the disease SUDs vs. Healthy: Individuals with cocaine use disorder show higher FDCR compared to controls in the frontoparietal network (Costumero et al., 2018) Individuals with cocaine use disorder compared to recreational stimulant users show greater orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate FDCR during a cocaine-cue Stroop task (Smith et al., 2014) SUD Subtyping: Among heavy alcohol drinkers, “relief” drinking (due to negative reinforcement or habit) compared to reward drinking (due to positive reinforcement) is associated with greater dorsal striatal FDCR (Burnette et al., 2021). Individuals with cannabis use disorder and early-onset cannabis use show FDCR in the dorsal striatum, while those with late-onset use shoe FDCR in the ventral striatum (Wetherill et al., 2016) Severity Is correlated with a disease indicator In individuals with opioid use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala is associated with drug use severity, and withdrawal symptoms mediate the relationship between nucleus accumbens FDCR and drug use severity (Shi et al., 2021). Prognostic Identifies the likelihood of a clinical event, disease recurrence or progression in patients who have the disease or medical condition of interest Among individuals with stimulant use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens was prospectively associated with time to relapse and could classify patients into those who would relapse and those would not at 3 months after the scan, with an accuracy outperforming predictions using conventional measures (MacNiven et al., 2018). Monitoring Is measured repeatedly for assessing status of a disease or medical condition or for evidence of exposure to (or effect of) a medical product or environmental agent Naturalistic Monitoring: Among female cigarette smokers, frontal, temporal and parietal regions show FDCR during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle but not the luteal phase (Mendrek et al., 2014). Among participants with internet gaming disorder followed over one year, natural recovery from IGD was associated with decreased anterior cingulate and lentiform FDCR and an increase in cue-related effective ACC-lentiform connectivity (Dong et al., 2019). Treatment Monitoring: In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with alcohol use disorder, naltrexone lowers ventral striatal FDCR from baseline and more FDCR reduction was associated with a greater clinical response (Schacht et al., 2017). Predictive Identifies individuals who are more likely than similar individuals without the biomarker to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a medical product or environmental agent In individuals with alcohol use disorder, the existence of left putamen FDCR at baseline and the reduction of left putamen FDCR early during treatment predict the effectiveness of Naltrexone (Bach et al., 2020). In individuals with alcohol use disorder, high baseline FDCR in the ventral striatum can predict response to Naltrexone (which reduces positive reinforcement and cue-reactivity) but not Acamprosate (which inhibits negative reinforcement) (Mann et al., 2014). This finding has been directly replicated (Bach et al., 2021). Response Shows that a biological response has occurred in an individual who has been exposed to a medical product or environmental agent Biological Response: In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with cocaine use disorder, modafinil acutely reduces FDCR in the ventral tegmental area and increases FDCR in the anterior cingulate and putamen, eliminating differences between dependent participants and healthy controls (Goudriaan et al., 2013). Potential Surrogate Endpoint: In a randomized sham-controlled trial of chronic smokers, active versus sham tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increases cue-related functional connectivity between the dLPFC and the parahippocampus, and that this increase is correlated with decreases in cigarette craving (Yang et al., 2017). Safety Is measured before or after an exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent to indicate the likelihood, presence, or extent of toxicity as an adverse effect Contributing to discussions on the safety of electronic cigarettes, FDCR has been used to show that e-cigarette smoking may immediately increase FDCR (Nichols et al., 2016). Furthermore, sweet taste and nicotine content have supra-additive influence on nucleus accumbens FDCR to the sight and smell of e-cigarettes (Kroemer et al., 2018).

"],["descussion.html", "Descussion", " Descussion There has been steady interest in FDCR across the years, though the evidence is most extensive for nicotine and alcohol. The methodological parameter-space of FDCR is highly heterogeneous. The methodological heterogeneity notwithstanding, there a growing literature is establishing relationships between FDCR and craving and other psychological variables, as well as other neuroimaging and physiological paradigms used in addiction sciences. The literature could potentially contribute to the development of a variety of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis or intervention in drug development or clinical contexts, especially for nicotine and alcohol use disorders.
