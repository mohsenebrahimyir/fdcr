After the analytical and clinical validation of the biomarker and cost-benefit analysis, the compiled evidence is presented for regulatory approval. The FDA evaluates the use of biomarkers for drug development through a biomarker qualification process involving the submission of a Letter of Intent, a Qualification Plan, and a Full Qualification Package, while use of FDCR-derived biomarker in preclinical or clinical contexts requires the endorsement of a constellation of other institutions"

    "Baseline cue-reactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula was greater in individuals who subsequently transitioned from moderate to heavy drinking compared to non-transitioners (Dager et al., 2014)",
  "**SUDs vs. Healthy:**
  
*Individuals with cocaine use disorder showed higher FDCR compared to controls in a frontoparietal network (Costumero et al., 2018)

*Individuals with cocaine use disorder compared to people with recreational stimulant use showed greater orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate FDCR during a cocaine-cue Stroop task (Smith et al., 2014)

**SUD Subtyping:**

*Among people with heavy alcohol consumption, “relief” drinking (due to negative reinforcement or habit) compared to reward drinking (due to positive reinforcement) was associated with greater dorsal striatal FDCR (Burnette et al., 2021)

*Individuals with cannabis use disorder and early-onset cannabis use showed FDCR in the dorsal striatum, while those with late-onset use showed FDCR in the ventral striatum (Wetherill et al., 2016)",
  "In individuals with opioid use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala was associated with drug use severity (Addiction Severity Index Drug Composite Score), and withdrawal symptoms mediated the relationship between nucleus accumbens FDCR and drug use severity (Shi et al., 2021)",
  "Among individuals with stimulant use disorder, baseline FDCR in the nucleus accumbens was prospectively associated with time to relapse and could classify individuals into those who would relapse and those would not at 3 months after the scan, with an accuracy outperforming predictions using self-reported and clinical measures (MacNiven et al., 2018)",
  "**Naturalistic Monitoring:**

*Among women with tobacco use disorder, frontal, temporal, and parietal regions showed FDCR during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle but not the luteal phase (Mendrek et al., 2014)

*Among participants with internet gaming disorder (IGD) followed over one year, natural recovery from IGD was associated with decreased anterior cingulate and lentiform FDCR and an increase in cue-related effective anterior cingulate cortex-lentiform connectivity (Dong et al., 2019)

**Treatment Monitoring:**

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with alcohol use disorder, naltrexone lowered ventral striatal FDCR from baseline, and more FDCR reduction was associated with greater clinical response (Schacht et al., 2017)",
  "*In individuals with alcohol use disorder, the existence of left putamen FDCR at baseline and the reduction of left putamen FDCR early during treatment predicted the effectiveness of naltrexone (Bach et al., 2020)

*In individuals with alcohol use disorder, high baseline FDCR in the ventral striatum statistically predicted response to naltrexone (Mann et al., 2014). Notably, this finding has been directly replicated (Bach et al., 2021)",
  "**Biological Response:**

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of individuals with cocaine use disorder, modafinil acutely reduced FDCR in the ventral tegmental area and increased FDCR in the anterior cingulate and putamen, eliminating differences between participants with cocaine use disorder and healthy control participants (Goudriaan et al., 2013)

**Potential Surrogate Endpoint:**

In a randomized sham-controlled trial involving people with tobacco use disorder, active versus sham tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) increased cue-related functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the parahippocampus, and this increase was correlated with decreased cigarette craving (Yang et al., 2017)",
  "Contributing to discussions on the safety of electronic cigarettes, FDCR showed that e-cigarette smoking may immediately increase FDCR (T. T. Nichols et al., 2016). Furthermore, sweet taste and nicotine content may synergistically influence the nucleus accumbens FDCR to the sight and smell of e-cigarettes (Kroemer et al., 2018). Safety FDCR biomarkers may overlap with prognostic or response biomarkers in the context of SUDs since SUDs involve the use of substances whose safety may be assessed using FDCR"
